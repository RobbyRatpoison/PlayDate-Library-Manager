# PlayDate

A local game library manager for people who take their backlog seriously.

Pulls your Steam library and any connected platforms, enriches games with metadata, cover art, and HowLongToBeat times, and gives you a clean interface for browsing, filtering, tracking completion, and deciding what to play next. Runs entirely locally as a standalone desktop app.

## Features

- **Library** — grid and list views with live search, sorting, and a powerful filter system (simple dropdowns or nested AND/OR groups with custom SQL). Bulk edit any field across a selection of games.
- **Home page** — configurable shelves driven by any saved filter or built-in preset. Add widgets, pair shelves side-by-side, and set per-shelf limits and sort order.
- **Pick 6** — find something to play. Random mode picks from your full unbeaten library. Smart mode builds a taste profile from your beaten games and scores candidates by tags, reviews, playtime, staleness, and release date.
- **Non-Steam libraries** — connect GOG, itch.io, Humble Bundle, and more via the Plugins menu. Games from all sources appear alongside your Steam library.
- **Emulators** — point PlayDate at your ROM folders and it scans them into your library with automatic cover art.
- **Metadata** — Steam tags, reviews, achievements, release info, and HowLongToBeat times. Playtime and last-played stay in sync with your local Steam files on every launch.
- **Artwork** — vertical capsule art, horizontal headers, and icons; falls back through Steam CDN paths to SteamGridDB. Browse and apply custom art from within PlayDate.
- **Completion tracking** — Never Played, Unfinished, Beaten, Completed, Won't Play. Right-click any card for a quick-set menu.
- **Gamepad support** — full controller navigation across all pages.

## Installation

### Windows

Download **PlayDate-Setup.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/RobbyRatpoison/PlayDate-Library-Manager/releases/latest) and run it. No Python required.

Prefer portable? Download **PlayDate-Windows-Portable.zip**, extract anywhere, and run `PlayDate.exe`.

**Requirements:** Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit). Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is required — it ships pre-installed on Windows 10/11.

### Linux

Install the WebKit/GTK system dependencies for your distro first:

```bash
# Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS, etc.
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-webkit2-4.0 python3-venv python3-pip python3-tk

# Fedora, Nobara, Ultramarine, etc.
sudo dnf install python3-gobject webkit2gtk4.0 python3-tkinter

# Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS, Garuda, etc.
sudo pacman -S python-gobject webkit2gtk-4.1 tk

# openSUSE
sudo zypper install python3-gobject typelib-1_0-WebKit2-4_0
```

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x launch.sh && ./launch.sh
```

On first run, `launch.sh` sets up a virtual environment, installs Python dependencies, and registers a desktop entry so PlayDate appears in your app launcher. After that it just launches. Re-running it after moving the folder keeps the desktop entry up to date.

To run **Windows** games or launchers from non-Steam plugins (GOG, Epic, EA App, etc.), you also need a Windows runtime plus `winetricks` and `p7zip`/`7zip`. Native Linux games (common on GOG and itch.io) need none of this.

Some plugins work with plain Wine; several **require GE-Proton together with [umu-launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher)** — installing all of it is the safe choice.

```bash
# Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS   (umu-launcher: .deb from its GitHub releases — not in apt)
sudo apt install wine winetricks p7zip-full

# Fedora, Nobara
sudo dnf install wine winetricks p7zip p7zip-plugins umu-launcher

# Arch, CachyOS, EndeavourOS   (multilib enabled)
sudo pacman -S wine winetricks p7zip umu-launcher
```

Install **GE-Proton** with [ProtonUp-Qt](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/), or use Steam's built-in Proton.

### Linux (Flatpak)

Download **PlayDate-\<version\>-Linux.flatpak** from the [latest release](https://github.com/RobbyRatpoison/PlayDate-Library-Manager/releases/latest), then either double-click it in your file manager or install it from a terminal:

```bash
flatpak install PlayDate-<version>-Linux.flatpak
```

If your system doesn't already have Flathub configured as a remote, the bundle fetches the missing GNOME runtime from Flathub automatically. The Flatpak stays up to date on its own — updates ship via an in-app "Perform Update" button, and it's also compatible with `flatpak update` or GNOME Software once installed.

Windows games and launchers from non-Steam plugins need the same runtime as the source install above — Wine, or GE-Proton + [umu-launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher), plus `winetricks` and `p7zip`/`7zip` — but installed on the **host** system, not as Flatpaks, since PlayDate runs them via `flatpak-spawn --host`. Native Linux games need none of it.

### Steam Deck

The Flatpak build above is the recommended way to install PlayDate on Steam Deck. In Desktop Mode, download the `.flatpak` file and double-click it to install via Discover, or use the terminal command above — no sudo password or system package setup required. It runs entirely sandboxed and updates like any other Flatpak app.

If you'd rather run from source instead, set a sudo password first if you haven't already:

```bash
passwd
```

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x install_steamdeck.sh && ./install_steamdeck.sh
```

This installs the required system packages and runs the setup. If PlayDate stops launching after a SteamOS system update, re-run `install_steamdeck.sh` — it's safe to run multiple times.

### macOS

```bash
chmod +x launch.sh && ./launch.sh
```

On first run, `launch.sh` sets up the virtual environment and creates a `PlayDate.app` bundle in `~/Applications`. Re-running it after moving the folder keeps the bundle up to date.

---

## Uninstallation

### Windows
Use **Add or Remove Programs** — PlayDate registers a standard uninstaller.

### Linux / macOS
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

### Linux (Flatpak)
```bash
flatpak uninstall io.github.robbyratpoison.PlayDate
```
