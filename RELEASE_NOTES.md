# Release Notes

## v1.10.3 - Pending
### Improvements

- Linux: added an experimental Qt renderer option (Settings → Renderer) to fix choppy library scrolling on NVIDIA + Wayland. On Flatpak, switching installs a separate app and removes the one you're switching from.
- Gamepad/d-pad navigation on the library and home pages now scrolls smoothly into view and no longer hides the focused card behind the top bar.
- Backups now include your custom background image and uploaded card-badge icons.
- Restoring a backup on a different machine no longer carries over settings tied to the old one (window size and position, renderer choice).

### Fixes

- The library page now shows a "Show All Games" button when a filter or hidden platform leaves nothing to display.

## v1.10.2 - 2026-09-05
### Improvements

- Wine/Proton game launches can now pass extra command-line arguments and a custom working directory, for plugins that need it.
- All launcher-based plugins now detect a native Windows install via the system registry, catching custom install locations.
- All launcher-based plugins now offer Start Launcher and Open Folder buttons.
- When PlayDate can't confidently pick which file to launch for an itch.io, Humble, or IndieGala game, it now asks — changeable anytime via right-click → Change Executable.

### Fixes

- Restore now stops any bulk jobs before replacing the database.
- Confirming an HLTB match in the edit modal no longer reverts on reopen.
- The Battle.net plugin now works on Linux — library sync, install, launch, and uninstall, no sign-in required. Moved from the beta Plugin Catalog section to the regular one.
- The Amazon Games plugin's account connection and library sync now work. Install/launch/uninstall were rewritten too but are unverified against an owned game — please report back if you have one.
- The Rockstar Games plugin now installs the real launcher under Wine and syncs your library from it directly (no account needed), with install/launch/uninstall handled through it. Only tested against one game so far — please report back what you see.
- Fixed 32-bit Windows games crashing on launch under Wine/Proton from a mismatched graphics library — affects every Wine-based plugin.
- Fixed itch.io, IndieGala, and GOG sometimes picking a 32-bit Linux binary over 64-bit, which doesn't run under the Flatpak build.
- Fixed EA App's Start Launcher button not working under the Flatpak build.
