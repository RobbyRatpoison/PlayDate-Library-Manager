# Writing a PlayDate Plugin

Plugins add non-Steam library sources (GOG, Epic, EA App, etc.) to PlayDate. Nothing ships as source in the main PlayDate repo, including PlayDate's own first-party integrations — GOG, EA App, Epic Games, Humble Bundle, IndieGala, itch.io, and Ubisoft Connect are just plugins too, published as their own GitHub repos (`plugins.OFFICIAL_PLUGINS`) and installed the same way as any third-party plugin. Each plugin lives in its own subdirectory under a writable, update-safe directory and is auto-discovered at startup.

**Where plugins actually live:** `plugins._user_plugins_dir()`, which resolves to `BASE_DIR/plugins/` — the same base directory that already holds `config.json`/`games.db`. For a Flatpak install that's the app's isolated data directory, not the read-only `/app` mount; for a frozen build it's the folder next to the executable; for a source checkout it's this project's own `plugins/` folder (since `BASE_DIR` *is* the project root there, so it's literally the same physical directory you're looking at in this repo). PlayDate also still scans the bundled `plugins/` folder next to `plugins/__init__.py` for anything left over from the old single-directory layout, and migrates it into the writable directory automatically on startup — this only matters for a plugin manually dropped into that legacy location; a normal install never puts anything there.

## Installing a plugin

Users can install plugins four ways:

1. **Plugins modal → Plugin Catalog** (hamburger menu → Plugins) — one-click install for PlayDate's own first-party plugins (`plugins.OFFICIAL_PLUGINS`), listed automatically whenever one isn't currently installed (`GET /api/plugins/catalog`). Grouped into expandable Working / Untested / Broken sections based on each entry's `platform_status` for whatever OS PlayDate is actually running on right now — not a full cross-platform matrix, just "is this worth trying on my system." There's no separate experimental/beta tier; an unproven plugin simply shows as Untested.
2. **Plugins modal → Install from Zip** — select a `.zip` file; the server validates it, extracts it to the writable plugins directory (see above), and prompts for restart.
3. **Plugins modal → Install from GitHub** — paste a GitHub repo URL (`github.com/owner/repo` or `owner/repo`); PlayDate fetches the latest release zip and installs it the same way.
4. **Manual drop** — copy the plugin folder directly into the writable plugins directory and restart.

The zip can be either flat (`plugin.json` at root) or wrapped in a single top-level folder (`myplugin/plugin.json`). The plugin `id` in `plugin.json` must be alphanumeric + underscores and determines the destination folder name.

Every install method requires a restart to actually take effect — Flask refuses to register a new Blueprint once the app has served its first request, so a freshly-installed plugin's code sits on disk, loaded but inactive, until the next launch.

If a plugin is hosted on GitHub and its `plugin.json` includes a `source` field, PlayDate will check for updates when the Plugins modal is opened and show a one-click update button when a newer release is available.

Uninstalling a plugin deletes its directory outright (`shutil.rmtree`) and clears its saved credentials/launcher config — this is what makes it stick across a PlayDate update now, since there's no bundled copy anywhere for an update to silently reintroduce.

## Directory layout

```
plugins/
  myplugin/
    __init__.py    # plugin class + singleton
    plugin.json    # manifest
    routes.py      # Flask Blueprint
    templates/     # optional UI fragments (see below)
    static/        # optional static assets (CSS, JS, images)
    watcher.py     # optional filesystem watcher
```

## plugin.json

```json
{
  "id":       "myplugin",
  "name":     "My Platform",
  "version":  "1.0.0",
  "platform": "myplugin",
  "author":   "",
  "source":   "github:owner/myplugin-repo",
  "icon":     "icon.png"
}
```

The `id` and `platform` values must be unique across all plugins and must match the string you store in the `platform` column of the `games` table.

### `icon` field (optional)

A platform badge, shown in the Plugins modal (and reused elsewhere as a game-card platform badge). Point it at a file in the plugin directory (`.png`, `.webp`, `.jpg`, or `.svg`). Use a **square, edge-to-edge image** — the store's own app icon is ideal — because the UI circle-masks it; a transparent wordmark will be mostly clipped away. Served verbatim as an `<img>` source (never inlined), so an SVG here cannot run script. Recommended size 128x128.

### `launcher` field (optional)

If your plugin needs a separate launcher application (e.g. Epic Games Store, EA App) to run games, declare it:

```json
"launcher": {
  "required": true,
  "name": "Epic Games Store",
  "exe_name": "EpicGamesLauncher.exe"
}
```

Set `"required": false` (or omit the field entirely) if your plugin can launch games without a separate launcher process. Core reads this field to drive launcher configuration UI -- no code changes are needed in the plugin itself beyond declaring it.

### `launcher.installer` field (optional) -- automated Wine-based launcher install

If your launcher can be installed unattended under Wine, declare an `installer` block and core will drive the whole install through `runners/launcher_installer.py` from a "Configure Launcher" button -- no plugin code needed:

```json
"launcher": {
  "required": true,
  "name": "My Launcher",
  "exe_name": "MyLauncher.exe",
  "installer": {
    "url": "https://example.com/MyLauncherInstaller.exe",
    "type": "exe",
    "winearch": "win64",
    "win_version": "win10",
    "winetricks": ["d3dcompiler_43", "corefonts"],
    "post_install_files": [
      {"path": "AppData\\Local\\My Launcher\\settings.yaml", "content": "overlay:\n  enabled: false"}
    ],
    "post_install_dlls": ["files/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/some.dll"],
    "install_path": "Program Files (x86)\\My Launcher",
    "env": {"SOME_VAR": "1"}
  }
}
```

Fields (all but `url` optional):
- `url` -- installer download URL.
- `type` -- `"msi"` (default), `"exe"` (run interactively -- the user completes the setup window), or `"extract"` (bypass the installer entirely and 7z-extract its payload directly into the prefix at `install_path`; for installers that refuse to run at all without admin rights under Wine).
- `winearch` -- `"win64"` (default) or `"win32"`.
- `win_version` -- if set, writes `HKCU\Software\Wine\Version` to this value (e.g. `"win10"`) right after prefix creation.
- `winetricks` -- list of verbs installed (in order) before the installer runs. Proton wine automatically falls back to system `wine` for this step (winetricks and Proton's own wine binary don't mix).
- `post_install_files` -- list of `{"path": ..., "content": ...}` written into the Wine user profile directory (`path` relative to it, backslashes accepted) after winetricks but *before* the installer runs -- for pre-seeding a config file the installer or first-run would otherwise create with different defaults (e.g. disabling an overlay before it ever gets a chance to inject itself).
- `post_install_dlls` -- list of paths (relative to the detected Proton build's root, e.g. `files/lib/wine/x86_64-windows/xyz.dll`) copied into the prefix's `system32` after the installer completes.
- `install_path` -- required for `type: "extract"` (destination under `drive_c`, backslashes accepted); unused for `msi`/`exe`.
- `env` -- extra environment variables merged in for every step (prefix creation, winetricks, install).
- `detached_launcher` -- `true` for installers that never exit because the setup stub transitions its own process straight into the running launcher (Battle.net). Instead of waiting for the installer to exit (which then only ever ends at the 600s ceiling), core polls for `exe_name` to appear in the prefix and proceeds ~20s after it does, leaving the launcher running. Point `exe_name` at the fully-installed launcher exe, not an early bootstrapper file. `exe`-type installers only; ignored for `msi`.

`exe_name` (used to verify the install actually succeeded) is read from `launcher.exe_name` if not also set directly on `installer`.

Progress is tracked through phases (`creating_prefix` -> `downloading` -> `installing` -> `verifying` -> `done`), pollable via `GET /api/launcher-install/<platform_id>/status` -- no plugin-side polling code needed, the built-in Configure Launcher UI handles it.

The optional `source` field enables update checking. Set it to `github:owner/repo` pointing to the GitHub repository where releases are published. PlayDate compares the installed `version` against the latest release tag (stripping a leading `v`) and surfaces an update link in the Plugins modal when a newer version is available. Updates download and overwrite the plugin folder in-place; a restart is required to load the new code.

### `min_core_version` field (optional)

If your plugin relies on a lifecycle method, field, or behavior introduced in a specific PlayDate release, declare the minimum core version it needs:

```json
"min_core_version": "1.7.0"
```

At startup, `load_all()` compares this against the running PlayDate version. If the installed core is older, the plugin is **not imported or registered** — it fails safely instead of crashing on a missing method/field or throwing at import time. It still shows up in the Plugins modal with a "needs PlayDate X.Y.Z" message (fetched from `GET /api/plugins/incompatible`) and can still be uninstalled from there; only `register()` and everything after it in `load_all()` is skipped. Omit the field if your plugin has no minimum version requirement.

This is also enforced earlier, at install/update time: installing a zip, a GitHub URL, or clicking Update in the Plugins modal all funnel through the same install path, which rejects the install outright with a user-facing error if your declared `min_core_version` exceeds the user's current PlayDate version — it won't silently install and then fail to load on next restart. If you're bumping `min_core_version` alongside new PlayDate release requirements, be aware that a plugin update released the same day as the PlayDate version it requires is deliberately not blocked by the "install updates then update core" bundled flow (it compares against the *target* core version being installed, not the currently-running one).

If a newer release of an already-installed plugin raises `min_core_version` past the user's current PlayDate, the Plugins modal shows it as "vX.Y.Z · needs PlayDate A.B.C" (not a clickable standalone update), but still offers it through the combined **Update PlayDate & Plugins** button on the update prompt, which installs it against the newer core.

## __init__.py — the plugin class

`plugins/__init__.py` calls `mod.plugin` on your package, so `__init__.py` must expose a `plugin` singleton.

All lifecycle methods except `register` are optional — omit the ones you don't need.

## routes.py — Flask Blueprint

Use a Blueprint with a `/api/<plugin-id>` prefix. Add `template_folder='templates'` so Jinja2 can find your fragment templates. If you have static assets (CSS, JS, images), add `static_folder='static'` and `static_url_path='/plugins/<id>/static'` — files will be served at that URL path.

```python
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify, request
from database import get_db, update_game_data

bp = Blueprint('myplugin', __name__, url_prefix='/api/myplugin',
               template_folder='templates',
               static_folder='static',
               static_url_path='/plugins/myplugin/static')


@bp.route('/status')
def status():
    return jsonify({'connected': False})


@bp.route('/sync', methods=['POST'])
def sync():
    from .myplugin import sync_library
    result = sync_library()
    if 'error' in result:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': result['error']}), 400
    return jsonify({'status': 'success', **result})
```

## UI fragments

Plugins inject UI into core pages via named slots. Each slot is a small HTML or JS file in `plugins/myplugin/templates/`. The loader collects all registered fragments at startup; if no plugin registers a slot, nothing is rendered there.

### Available slots

| Slot | Rendered inside | Use for |
|------|----------------|---------|
| `base_head_styles` | `<style>` block in `<head>` | CSS for elements your nav fragment adds |
| `base_nav_items` | Hamburger menu, after the populate button | Persistent status buttons (e.g. install progress) |
| `base_body_scripts` | `<script>` block at end of `<body>` | JS that must exist on every page |
| `tools_scripts` | `<script>` block in `modal_tools.html` | JS for the manage modal (sync handlers, etc.) |
| `home_widget_<id>` | Home page, in place of the shelf matching `shelf.preset == '<id>'` | A Home page shelf widget, declared via `home_widgets()` |

### Naming convention

Prefix template filenames with your plugin id to avoid collisions across plugins:

```
plugins/myplugin/templates/
  myplugin_base_head_styles.html
  myplugin_base_nav_items.html
  myplugin_base_scripts.html
  myplugin_tools_scripts.html
```

### Example: adding a nav button

`myplugin_base_nav_items.html`:
```html
<button id="myplugin-status-btn" class="hamburger-item" style="display:none;">MY PLATFORM: SYNCING...</button>
```

`myplugin_base_head_styles.html`:
```css
#myplugin-status-btn { color: var(--accent); font-weight: bold; }
```

`myplugin_base_scripts.html`:
```js
// JS that controls #myplugin-status-btn on every page
```

### Calling plugin functions from core JS

Core templates use `typeof` guards for any soft calls into plugin JS, so missing plugins don't cause errors:

```js
if (typeof _myPluginRefresh === 'function') _myPluginRefresh();
```

Define complex sync handlers (e.g. `myPluginSync`) in your `tools_scripts` fragment and reference them by name in `manage_ui()` button actions using `{type: 'call', fn: 'myPluginSync'}`. Status output elements follow the id pattern `{plugin_id}-manage-status-{key}` so your JS can update them directly.

## Database integration

### Appid allocation

Non-Steam games use **negative integer appids** to avoid collisions with Steam. Allocate the next available one inside a single DB connection:

```python
def _next_negative_appid(db):
    row = db.execute('SELECT MIN(appid) FROM games WHERE appid < 0').fetchone()
    return (row[0] - 1) if row[0] is not None else -1
```

### Inserting a game

```python
db.execute(
    """INSERT OR IGNORE INTO games
       (appid, name, platform, platform_id, platform_slug, date_added,
        completion_status, installed,
        art_fetched, meta_fetched, cheevos_fetched,
        protondb_fetched, hltb_fetched)
       VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?,
               'Never Played', 0,
               '0', '0', '0', '0', '0')""",
    (next_appid, name, 'myplugin', platform_native_id, slug, date_added_unix_ts),
)
```

Key columns:

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `appid` | Negative integer, allocated via `_next_negative_appid` |
| `platform` | String matching your `plugin.json` `platform` field |
| `platform_id` | The service's own identifier for the game (used for launch/sync) |
| `platform_slug` | URL slug for building store links (optional) |
| `date_added` | Unix timestamp (INTEGER) |
| `completion_status` | Start with `'Never Played'` |
| `installed` | `0` or `1` |
| `art_fetched` / `meta_fetched` / `cheevos_fetched` | `'0'` until fetched; use `'YYYY-MM-DD'` once done |

### Skipping blacklisted games

Before inserting, check `platform_id` for games the user previously removed:

```python
blacklisted = {
    row[0]
    for row in db.execute(
        "SELECT platform_id FROM blacklist WHERE platform_id IS NOT NULL"
    ).fetchall()
}

if str(platform_native_id) in blacklisted:
    continue
```

### Updating game data

```python
from database import update_game_data
update_game_data(appid, installed=1, install_path='/games/MyGame')
```

`update_game_data` accepts any column name as a keyword argument.

## Optional: install watcher

If your platform installs games to a known directory, watch it with `watchdog` and sync install status on change. Use `runners.watcher.PluginInstallWatcher` — it encapsulates the Observer lifecycle and only requires a name and a sync callback:

```python
from runners.watcher import PluginInstallWatcher

def sync_install_status():
    # reset installed=0 for your platform, then set installed=1 for found games
    ...

_watcher = PluginInstallWatcher('myplugin', sync_install_status)

def start_watcher(watch_path):
    _watcher.start(watch_path)   # no-op if already running

def stop_watcher():
    _watcher.stop()
```

If `watch_path` doesn't exist yet when `start()` is called (e.g. a fresh prefix with nothing installed), it retries every 30s until the path appears, then attaches for good — you don't need to handle that case yourself or re-call `start()` later.

The sync callback pattern:

1. Reset all `installed` flags for your platform to `0`.
2. Walk the install directory and set `installed = 1` for found games.

## Shared runners

Reusable helpers in `runners/` that plugins should use rather than rolling their own:

### `runners/oauth2.py` — Generic OAuth2

For plugins that authenticate via OAuth2 authorization code + refresh token flow.

```python
from runners.oauth2 import exchange_authorization_code, get_valid_session

# Exchange code for tokens (returns raw token dict; raises ValueError on failure)
token_data = exchange_authorization_code(
    token_url, client_id, client_secret, code,
    redirect_uri=None,     # include if the provider requires it
    use_basic_auth=False,  # True for providers that use HTTP Basic auth (e.g. Epic)
)

# Get a requests.Session with a valid Bearer token (auto-refreshes; returns None if disconnected)
session = get_valid_session(
    'my_platform',         # key in config.json where tokens are stored
    token_url, client_id, client_secret,
    extra_headers=None,    # e.g. {'User-Agent': '...'}
    use_basic_auth=False,
)
```

Token storage convention: `config.json["my_platform"]` must contain `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `expires_at`. Any other keys (username, account_id, etc.) are preserved on refresh.

### `runners/watcher.py` — `PluginInstallWatcher`

See the install watcher section above.

### `runners/wine.py` — Wine helpers

```python
from runners.wine import find_wine_binary, list_prefixes, create_prefix, run_in_prefix, launch_protocol_url

# Open a Windows protocol URL (e.g. com.epicgames.launcher://...) inside a prefix
launch_protocol_url(prefix_path, url, wine_bin=None)
```

`launch_protocol_url()` and `run_in_prefix()` already handle Proton/umu-run routing, an already-running-session for the same prefix, and native-Wayland preference internally — plugins don't need to special-case any of that themselves. By default, when a session is already live they deliver into it with a plain `wine start`/`wine` call and never kill it. Pass `restart_session_if_running=True` only if your launcher is confirmed *not* to accept a deep link while running (Ubisoft Connect is the only one so far) — that ends the live session and cold-starts a fresh one.

If your plugin needs to know whether a real game (not just an idle launcher client) is currently running under its prefix before doing something disruptive (e.g. before ending/restarting a Wine session), use `runners.wine.list_prefix_processes(prefix_path)` — it returns `[(pid, argv0), ...]` for every process tied to that prefix, correctly matching both the bare prefix path and its Proton `<prefix>/pfx` subdirectory. Match `argv0` against your own game-install-path convention rather than an exclusion list of known launcher process names — an exclusion list breaks the moment an unrelated process (e.g. a container helper) also carries the prefix's `WINEPREFIX` env var.

## Checking for a plugin in templates

`has_plugin(id)` is available in every Jinja2 template for cases where fragment slots aren't enough:

```jinja2
{% if has_plugin('myplugin') %}
  <!-- platform-specific UI -->
{% endif %}
```

## Checklist for a new plugin

- [ ] `plugins/myplugin/` directory with `__init__.py`, `plugin.json`, `routes.py`
- [ ] Unique `id` and `platform` string in `plugin.json` and plugin class
- [ ] `source` set to `github:owner/repo` in `plugin.json` if the plugin is hosted on GitHub
- [ ] `label` set on plugin class (display name used in `window._PLAT_LABELS`)
- [ ] `template_folder='templates'` on the Blueprint if using fragments
- [ ] `static_folder='static'` + `static_url_path='/plugins/<id>/static'` if serving static assets

- [ ] `date_import_url` declared if the platform has an orders page the Tampermonkey script should open
- [ ] `launcher_status()` implemented if `plugin.json` sets `launcher.required: true`
- [ ] Blacklist check before inserting games
- [ ] Fragment template filenames prefixed with plugin id to avoid collisions
