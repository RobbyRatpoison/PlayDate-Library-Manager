"""Monkeypatches pywebview's stock QWebEngineView-based BrowserView with a
scaled-up mouse wheel delta.

QtWebEngine/Chromium's default per-notch scroll amount feels noticeably
slower than WebKitGTK's on the same page -- confirmed live comparing the
GTK and Qt renderers on PlayDate's own library grid. No Chromium flag or
QWebEngineSettings controls this. Mirrors gtk3webview_patch.py's approach:
patch pywebview's real platform module in place rather than forking/
duplicating its BrowserView implementation.

First attempt (overriding WebView.wheelEvent() directly) had zero effect
at any multiplier, confirmed live up to 50x -- overriding QWebEngineView's
own wheelEvent() doesn't intercept real scroll input at all. QtWebEngine's
actual Chromium rendering surface is a separate native child widget
(RenderWidgetHostViewQt) that receives wheel/mouse/keyboard events
directly; Qt's normal event propagation to the parent QWidget's own
virtual methods never enters into it. Confirmed independently by multiple
real QtWebEngine-based projects hitting the exact same thing (Qt Forum
reports, qutebrowser). The real fix, matching QupZilla's own
webview.cpp (their comment literally calls it "Hack to find widget that
receives input events"): install an event filter on view.focusProxy() --
but focusProxy() isn't valid immediately at construction; it only becomes
the real render widget once QWebEngineView's internal QStackedLayout
swaps it in, asynchronously, once Chromium's compositor is ready.
